# hesabe-crypt

> Encryption library for Hesabe Payment API 2.0

[![NPM Version][npm-image]][npm-url]

## Install

```bash
npm i -S hesabe-crypt
```

## Dependencies

A depency for this package `aes-js` will also get installed automatically and usage of that is shown below.

## Usage

After installing this library you may import the `Hesabe Crypt` class.

```bash
import hesabeCrypt from "hesabe-crypt";
```

You need to import `aes-js` also.

```bash
import aesjs from "aes-js";
```

You need to have a `secret` and an `iv code` to use this package.

Before starting encryption, you need to convert your `secret` and `iv` in bytes mentioned below:

```bash
let secret = 'XXXXX'        // Secret provided by Hesabe
let ivCode = 'XXXXX'        // IV provided by Hesabe

key = aesjs.utils.utf8.toBytes(secret);
iv = aesjs.utils.utf8.toBytes(ivKey);
```

You first need to initialise an intance of `hesabeCrypt` class and pass the `key` and `iv` while doing it.

```bash
let instance = new hesabeCrypt(key, iv);
```

You can now call the methods of `hesabeCrypt`.

```bash
let text = 'XXXXX';           // Any random text
let encrypted = instance.encryptAes(text);

let decrypted = instance.decryptAes(encrypted);

```
